## ü™° Introduction

With the rise of e-commerce, customers often feel overwhelmed by the vast range of outfit choices. Unlike traditional recommender systems that rely on user purchase history, **this project enables customers to upload any outfit image they like and receive visually similar outfit recommendations**.

This system helps:
- Users find lookalike outfits instantly.
- E-commerce platforms increase product discoverability.
- Fashion enthusiasts explore products visually.

## ‚ú® Features

‚úÖ Upload any outfit image and get top 5 visually similar outfit recommendations.  
‚úÖ Uses **ResNet50 with fine-tuning** for feature extraction.  
‚úÖ **Cosine Similarity with Nearest Neighbours** for fast, relevant retrieval.  
‚úÖ Simple, clean **Streamlit web interface**.  
‚úÖ Transfer learning to handle small fashion datasets effectively.

## üß© Methodology

1. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Uses **ResNet50** (fine-tuned) to extract feature embeddings from images.

2. **Inventory Embedding**  
   - Passes the Kaggle Fashion Product Images Dataset through the network to generate embeddings.

3. **Recommendation Generation**  
   - Uses **Scikit-learn‚Äôs Nearest Neighbours** with **Cosine Similarity** to find the most visually similar outfits to the uploaded image.
